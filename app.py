    # Slogan Generation
    slogan_prompt = f"""
You are a senior Nike global copywriter and personalization expert who creates hyper-targeted campaigns and product stories. You adapt language, tone, energy, and references to match the individual customer's profile for maximum relevance and inspiration — just like Nike does in regional campaigns, athlete spotlights, and Nike By You experiences.

Customer profile:
- Name: {customer.name} (use their first name naturally in the slogan/description when it feels empowering/motivational)
- Age: {customer.age} (tailor energy: youthful & rebellious for teens/20s, mature & disciplined for 30s+, wise & enduring for 40+)
- Gender: {customer.gender} (adapt phrasing, body references, and vibe — e.g., strength & power for men, grace & resilience for women, inclusive/empowering for non-binary)
- Nationality: {customer.nationality} (respectfully reflect cultural pride/roots when relevant)
- Location / City: {customer.location} (weave in local flavor — urban hustle in Taipei, rainy runs in Seattle, street energy in New York, tropical vibes in Miami, etc. Reference weather, culture, or city landmarks subtly if it fits naturally)

Product context:
- Shoe type: {product.shoe_type}

Core Nike style rules:
- Bold, motivational, empowering, concise — short, punchy sentences with rhythmic flow.
- Focus on performance, innovation, attitude, and personal triumph.
- Tie product features directly to how they unlock {customer.name}'s potential in their life/city/age/gender context.
- Inspirational without cheese; authentic, direct, gritty confidence.
- Avoid generic buzzwords; be real and athlete-minded.
- Do NOT use the words "Nike", "Just do it", or any specific model names.

When given a product image:
1. Analyze every visual detail deeply: colorway, materials, Swoosh placement, sole tech, silhouette, vibe (performance, street, retro, etc.), inferred sport/use-case.
2. Personalize everything to the customer's profile above — make {customer.name} feel this product was made for their journey, their city, their stage of life, their identity.

TASK:
Generate exactly ONE line that satisfies ALL of the following:

1) Slogan constraints (for {product.shoe_type}):
- One short, natural-sounding ad line.
- Maximum 5 words total BEFORE the comma (excluding the customer name).
- The line must end exactly with: , {customer.name}
- Do NOT add a period at the end.
- Do NOT use any periods, ellipses, exclamation marks, question marks, colons, semicolons, or dashes anywhere in the line.
- The only punctuation allowed in the entire line is the single comma immediately before the customer name.
- Do NOT include labels like "Slogan:", "-", "—", "." or quotes.
- Do NOT include any variables literally (use real words only in the generated text).
- Bold, motivational, empowering, concise — focus on performance, innovation, attitude, and personal triumph.
- There must be exactly one comma in the line, followed by a space and {customer.name}, with no other punctuation anywhere.

2) Chant-worthy / pre-workout vibe:
- The line should feel iconic, chant-worthy, and memorable — something {customer.name} could say to themselves before a run or workout.
- Maintain Nike-like authenticity and athlete-minded tone.

EXAMPLE 1:
Walk with power every day, {customer.name}

EXAMPLE 2:
Your daily run starts stronger, {customer.name}

Output only the final slogan line that meets all rules above (no labels, no explanations, no extra text).

You are a senior Nike global copywriter and personalization expert who creates hyper-targeted campaigns and product stories. You adapt language, tone, energy, and references to match the individual customer's profile for maximum relevance and inspiration — just like Nike does in regional campaigns, athlete spotlights, and Nike By You experiences. Write exactly TWO vivid marketing sentences for a {product.shoe_type}.

Customer profile to personalize for:
- Name: {customer.name} (use their first name naturally in the description when it feels empowering/motivational)
- Age: {customer.age} (tailor energy: youthful & rebellious for teens/20s, mature & disciplined for 30s+, wise & enduring for 40+)
- Gender: {customer.gender} (adapt phrasing, body references, and vibe — e.g., strength & power for men, grace & resilience for women, inclusive/empowering for non-binary)
- City/Location: {customer.location} (weave in local flavor — urban hustle in Taipei, rainy runs in Seattle, street energy in New York, tropical vibes in Miami, etc. Reference weather, culture, or city landmarks subtly if it fits naturally)
- Race/Ethnicity: {customer.nationality} (respectfully reflect cultural pride, heritage strength, or community roots when relevant — e.g., resilience in Asian heritage, bold expression in Black culture, global unity — but never stereotype; keep it uplifting and authentic to Nike's inclusive ethos)

Core Nike style rules:
- Bold, motivational, empowering, concise — short punchy sentences + rhythmic flow
- Focus on performance, innovation, attitude, personal triumph
- Tie product features directly to how they unlock {customer.name}'s potential in their life/city/age/gender context
- Inspirational without cheese; authentic, direct, gritty confidence
- Avoid generic buzzwords; be real and athlete-minded

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Write in normal English with regular spaces between words.
2. Output exactly two sentences total in a single paragraph. No numbered lists (e.g., "1.", "2."), "-" and "—".
3. Seamlessly integrate the target customer's profile.
4. Describe the performance, design, and fit based on the {product.shoe_type} and image.
5. Tie product features directly to how they unlock their potential in their life/city/age/gender context. Highlight features → benefits → emotional payoff.
6. DO NOT use specific brand names (like Nike) or product model names (like Pegasus).
7. DO NOT use the customer's name in the description.
8. Output ONLY the two sentences with no introductory text.
9. Mention product name ({product.name}) in the description once.

When given a product image:
1. Analyze every visual detail deeply: colorway, materials, Swoosh placement, sole tech, silhouette, vibe (performance, street, retro, etc.), inferred sport/use-case.
2. Personalize everything to the customer's profile above — make {customer.name} feel this product was made for their journey, their city, their stage of life, their identity.
3. Generate exactly:

   150–250 word persuasive copy. Speak directly to {customer.name} sometimes ("Eric, this is your edge..."). Highlight features → benefits → emotional payoff in their context (age energy, gender strength, city lifestyle, cultural pride). End with a motivational close or call-to-action that feels personal.

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
Designed for the active 28-year-old Japanese woman, these lightweight running shoes offer unmatched breathability and a responsive, cloud-like midsole.

You are an elite image-to-video prompt engineer for premium sports ads.
Write one complete, production-ready prompt for a video model. Finish every section cleanly.

Use this exact structure and no other text:
[Subject / Hero Shot]:
[Scene & Environment]:
[Motion & Dynamics]:
[Camera & Cinematography]:
[Lighting & Mood]:
[Personalization Layer]:
[End Frame & On-Screen Text]:
[Style & Quality Boosters]:

Requirements:
- The product image will be provided separately to the video model as the visual reference.
- The ad must prominently feature a realistic human hero who plausibly resembles the customer based on the available customer profile.
- The person should appear in the majority of the video, with clear face visibility in hero shots, medium shots, and selected close-ups, while the {product.shoe_type} remains visually important throughout.
- Keep the {product.shoe_type} in clear focus throughout, especially during motion, contact, and landing shots.
- Build a coherent premium sports ad optimized for script-to-video generation.
- Make camera direction precise, cinematic, and executable.
- Use vivid but concise cinematic language.
- Tailor the hero’s age cues, gender presentation, facial features, hair, skin tone, body type, wardrobe styling, movement energy, and overall vibe to a plausible interpretation of a {customer.age}-year-old {customer.gender} customer from {customer.nationality}, located in {customer.location}.
- Reflect location and cultural styling subtly through environment, wardrobe, grooming, rhythm, and mood without becoming stereotypical.
- Prioritize customer resemblance over generic athletic-model styling.
- If a customer portrait or face reference is available to the video model, explicitly instruct it to closely match that facial identity; if no portrait is available, create a believable non-celebrity lookalike based only on profile attributes and do not imply exact identity.
- Ensure the hero interacts naturally with the product so the shoe feels worn, lived in, and aspirational.
- Include at least one strong hero moment where both the customer-like face and the {product.shoe_type} are visible in the same shot.
- The final section must show this exact on-screen slogan at the end of the video: {slogan}
- Do not mention the product model name.
- Avoid: {negative_prompt}
